### üòÑ About Me

Passionate about **bridging the gap between customers and technology**. With a foundation in **AI/ML and full-stack development**, I thrive on translating complex business challenges into innovative technical solutions that **deliver real world impact**.

I excel at being the technical translator in cross-functional teams - someone who can speak both the language of business stakeholders and development teams to ensure solutions truly address core needs. My goal is to create technology that not only functions beautifully but genuinely improves how businesses operate.
